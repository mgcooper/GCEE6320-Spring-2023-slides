## Bonus: Learn how to create presentations using Markdown and Marp

This repository also serves as a demonstration of how to create presentations using [Marp](https://marp.app) (Markdown Presentation Ecosystem), specifically designed for students and educators to learn how to prepare slide decks using the Markdown language ([learn Markdown here](https://www.markdownguide.org)). 

**Compose your slides in Marp, and export them directly to pdf. No PowerPoint required.**

Why use Marp? Creating presentations by hand in PowerPoint is time consuming. Marp automates many repetitive tasks. Writing in Markdown is intuitive. Place your presentations under version control using git. Never end up with `my_awesome_presentation_v3_rewrite_NEW_FIGURES_v12_DONT_DELETE.pptx` again! Maintain one clean version of your awesome presentation, and use version control to make edits.

Below are concise steps to use the provided source files and export them to PDF using Marp in VSCode.

### Steps to Create Presentations with Marp

1. **Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode):**
   - Download and install VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install the Marp for VS Code Extension:**
   - Open VSCode.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
   - Search for "Marp for VS Code" and install it.

3. **Open the Source Files:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the `src` directory where the Markdown files are located.
   - Open the desired `.md` file in VSCode.

4. **Preview the Slides:**
   - With the Markdown file open, click on the "Preview" button that appears in the top-right corner of the editor (or press `Ctrl+k v` on Windows or `Cmd+k v` on Mac).
   - This will open a Marp preview of your slides.

5. **Export to PDF:**
   - Once you're satisfied with your slides, you can export them to PDF.
   - Click on the "Marp: Export Slide Deck" icon at the top of the preview pane
   - If you don't see the icon, use the command palette
     - Type `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and search for "Marp: Export" to choose the export format (PDF, PPTX, etc.).
   - Select the desired format and location to save your exported file.

### Notes

- The `src` directory contains the original Markdown files for two presentations:
  - `GCEE6320_Day1_Slides.md`
  - `GCEE6320_Day2_Slides.md`
- These Markdown files are the source files used to create the PDF presentations found in the respective term directories (`spring_2023` and `spring_2024`).
<!-- - Use these Markdown source files as examples to learn how to compose slide decks in Marp.
- _Sidenote_: The Markdown source files are updated over time, whereas the exported pdf files are maintained in their respective term directories. Users with git experience can cherry-pick the specific versions used to create the pdf files in each respective term directory, for example to recompile the PDFs. -->

By following these steps, you can utilize the source files in this repository to learn and create your own presentations using Marp. This provides a modern approach to slide deck creation and showcases an example of how to integrate Markdown with presentation tools for effective teaching materials.
